# 🍔 Food Delivery Time Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Food delivery platforms need accurate delivery time estimates to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.  
This project focuses on predicting **food delivery time** using **machine learning techniques** based on factors such as distance, preparation time, traffic conditions, and order details.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the estimated delivery time of food orders.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Customers often experience delays due to inaccurate delivery time predictions.  
This project aims to analyze historical delivery data and develop a predictive model that provides better time estimates.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to food delivery orders, including:

- Distance between restaurant and customer  
- Restaurant preparation time  
- Order type  
- Traffic conditions  
- Delivery personnel details  
- Actual delivery time (target variable)
